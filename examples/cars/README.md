# `cars`

Example model tackling the topic of nested-, or, meta- simulation.

Provided is a simple model for a world populated by cars driven on laid out
road track by driver agents.

Drivers have their basic rule-based behavior as well as an agenda for getting
from point a to point b.

On top of that however drivers are also capable of attempting predictions on
other drivers' behavior, and basing their own behavior on those predictions.
