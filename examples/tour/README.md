# `tour` model

This is an entry-level guide model, explaining the basic structure and contents
of bigworlds models.

Start with the `model.toml`. That's the starting point for any model you'll be
working with. You'll find each field commented with useful information.

Note that this model is meant as a passive introduction; you should read
through it to get the gist of things. The layout and data provided with this
model is not really coherent, as in: there's no point actually running it.

For runnable models with inspection and/or visualization options see other
models in the `examples` repository.
